## Description

AFBW is an input overhaul mod. It dramatically enhances the stock input system with a bunch of fixes and many new features

* Button combos!
* Plug & play
* Multiple presets

The mod adds a new button to the mod toolbar. Click the game controller icon or press Shift + L during flight to bring up AFBW's main configuration screen.
